Trapp is a Python project for linking, analyzing, and extending soccer data.

Trapp provides several tools for the user to work with soccer data:

1. Importer
2. Compiler
3. Renderer

Each of these will be described in more detail as the project progresses. For now, efforts are focused on the first tool, an importer capable of harvesting spreadsheet data into the appropriate database tables.
